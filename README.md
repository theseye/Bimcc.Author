# What is ForgeAuthor?

ForgeAuthor is a .net library based on .net framework 4.5, it provides a nice object oriented way to manipulate the Audesk Forge Svf Model, as simple as manipulate XML or JSON.

ForgeAuthor contains two major components, SvfDatabase and SvfDocument。

The main difference between SvfDatabase and SvfDocument is that SvfDatabase only manipulates properties data, while SvfDocument can manipulate full data of the model.

# Is ForgeAuthor free?
ForgeAuthor is commercial software, but using SvfDatabase to read and export properties data is permanently and completely free.

ForgeAuthor provides a 30-day full-functional trial period, but the free functionality of the ForgeAuthor after the trial period is still available.
